# Summary

## Introduction
Grad-Cam uses the gradient information flowing into the last convolutional layer of the CNN to understand each neuron for a decision of interest.


Let Ak be the kth feature map (k=1,â‹¯,K) from the last convolusional layer. Grad-CAM utilize these Ak to visualize the decision made by CNN.

* Visualization of the final feature map (Ak) will show the discriminative region of the image. <br />
* Simplest summary of all the Ak,k=1,...,K would be its linear combinations with some weights. <br />
* Some feature maps would be more important to make a decision on one class than others, so weights should depend on the class of interest. <br />
